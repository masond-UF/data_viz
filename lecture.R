# Raster data ####
	# conisder spatial extent (farthest location in cardinal directions is part
		# of your raster). 
	# resolution (area on the ground that each pixel of the raster covers)
	# data format = .tif, netCDF-CF (large files such as NOAA)
		# tif has metadata and tags (extent, CRS, values for missing data)
	# multi-band images can be plotted individually or concurrently
		# can include time series or multi (+4), hyperspectral (10-15)
	# Key points
		# pixelated, each associated with values at a specific location
		# has extent and resolution
# Vector data ####
	# points and lines = shapes 
	# extent, object type, and CRS
	# only contains either points, lines, or polygons
	# represent specific features with attributes
# Coordinate reference systems ####
